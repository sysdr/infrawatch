# Complete 180-Day Full-Stack Infrastructure

From zero-to-production every day — build, deploy, test, and operate real systems that employers and startups actually need.

**Fast pitch (30 seconds):** Follow a daily, battle-tested curriculum that takes you step-by-step from a single working backend to a portfolio of production-ready full-stack systems — with automated tests, CI/CD, observability, and ops know-how. No fluff. Hands-on. Career-backed outcomes.

## Why this course exists

Most engineering training teaches components: a frontend course here, a backend tutorial there, a CI video somewhere else. That produces fragmented knowledge, hesitation, and imposter syndrome when you try to ship.

This course fixes that by giving you:

* A **single, continuous 180-day roadmap** that connects the dots.
* Daily, practical tasks that build **muscle memory** for shipping infrastructure.
* Real-world patterns (testing, deployment, monitoring, rollback) — not just example code.

If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by tooling, unsure how pieces fit together, or unable to ship reliably — this course is built for you.

## What you’ll get (concrete outcomes)

By Day 180 you will have:

* A **portfolio** of at least 3 production-grade services (APIs, web apps, background workers) deployed to cloud infrastructure.
* A working **CI/CD pipeline** that runs tests, builds artifacts, and deploys safely.
* End-to-end **observability** (logs, metrics, basic alerting).
* Automated **testing** (unit + integration + smoke tests) and dependable rollback procedures.
* Clear **operational playbooks**: deploy, scale, incident triage, and postmortem steps.
* A repeatable playbook you can apply to any new product or job.

Short version: you won’t just “know” things — you’ll be able to **ship, operate, and explain** them in interviews and at work.

## Who this is for

* Early-career engineers who want to go from toy projects → production experience.
* Backend or frontend devs who need real infrastructure skills.
* Bootcamp grads who want to stand out with ops+infra.
* Founders who want to become their own first SRE/DevOps person.

No prior infra experience required — just curiosity and ~45–90 minutes/day.

## How it works — the method (what makes it different)

* **Daily micro-projects:** 180 days, each day a focused, achievable task. You get one thing to do and ship — not a vague longlist.
* **Project-first learning:** Every lesson ties into the projects you’re building. Tests, monitoring, and deployment are integrated into the codebase from day one.
* **Progressive complexity:** Start with a single API and evolve it into a scalable system with workers, caching, and observability.
* **Ops-mindset baked in:** Every feature includes operational steps — deployment scripts, health checks, rollback plan.
* **Templates & checklists:** Copy/paste production-grade templates for Docker, CI, IaC, test harnesses, and monitoring so you never reinvent the wheel.
* **Feedback loops:** Self-checks, automated tests, and suggested review checkpoints so you always know when you’ve done something well.

## Pain points → How the course solves them

**Pain:** “I learn tools but don’t know how to put them together.”
**Solution:** A single, continuous project ties tools into a working system every day.

**Pain:** “I can’t get a job because I don’t have production experience.”
**Solution:** Build production-ready services you can demo and walk through in interviews.

**Pain:** “I’m overwhelmed by choices — Kubernetes? Serverless? Terraform?”
**Solution:** Gradual, pragmatic choices with real trade-offs; templates to skip painful setup.

**Pain:** “I don’t know how to operate a service after deploy.”
**Solution:** Every module includes monitoring, alerting, and incident-response playbooks.

**Pain:** “I start projects but never finish.”
**Solution:** Daily momentum and small wins lock progress and prevent burnout.

## Curriculum snapshot (example milestones)

* **Week 1–2:** Single Python API, local dev → first deploy.
* **Week 3–4:** Testing fundamentals + CI pipeline.
* **Week 5–8:** Database migrations, caching, and background jobs.
* **Month 3:** Containerization + staging environments.
* **Month 4–5:** Observability (logs, metrics), load testing.
* **Month 6:** High-availability patterns, IaC, and final portfolio polish.

*(Each day has an explicit deliverable, code examples, and checklist.)*

## What you will actually build (examples)

* A user service with authentication, rate limits, DB migrations, and CI.
* A background worker that processes jobs, with retry logic and dead-letter handling.
* A public web app with canary deploys and basic autoscaling.
* An incident runbook and a postmortem you can show to employers.

## Learning commitments & format

* **Time:** ~45–90 minutes/day (flexible — do more on weekends).
* **Format:** Bite-sized lessons, code-first tutorials, reproducible templates.
* **Support:** Community channel + weekly office-hours (optional add-on).
* **Tools used:** Lightweight, widely used infra tooling (plain Docker, a mainstream cloud provider, GitHub Actions / CI, basic IaC). Choices are pragmatic — not trendy.

## Proof & confidence (social proof placeholders)

> “I shipped my first production API in Week 2 and got hands-on with CI/CD — best investment.” — *Student A*

> “Interviewers loved my incident postmortem — landed a job.” — *Student B*

*(Real testimonials drive conversions — swap these with actual quotes when available.)*

## Pricing & enrollment (copy you can adapt)

* **Free preview:** First 14 days of lesson access.
* **Full access:** One-time fee / subscription (choose pricing model) — includes templates, full lesson archive, downloadable playbooks.
* **Premium option:** 1:1 review + weekly office hours + résumé/interview coaching.

*(We can write optimized pricing copy next if you want.)*

## FAQ (short & persuasive)

**Q: Do I need cloud credits?**
**A:** You’ll need a free-tier cloud account for deploy tests; the course shows low-cost ways to run everything for under $5/month during learning.

**Q: Is this for newcomers or seniors?**
**A:** Beginner-friendly but also valuable for mid-level devs who haven’t shipped infra end-to-end.

**Q: Can I use this for interviews?**
**A:** Absolutely — the course intentionally produces artifacts you can demo and explain technically.
